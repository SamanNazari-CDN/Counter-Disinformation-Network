Actor type taxonomy

Actor Attribution - James Pamment and Victoria Smith's framework.
This framework is a temporary one that will be replaced when a standard is established in the field.


We use James Pamment and Victoria Smith’s attribution evidence framework and design a taxonomy. Pamment and Smith’s framework:



Read the full paper here.



To Pamment and Smith’s framework, we add:


Personnel - E.g. shared board members with an already attributed entity, 	shared editorial staff with an already attributed entity, same journalists as an already attributed entity.


Partnerships and repeated joint projects - e.g. partnerships between an attributed entity and another entity. E.g. repeated collaboration with an attributed entity to launch events or create content.



Systematic amplification of content from an attributed source, e.g. including mirroring websites, and news aggregators.


Labels
The following labels describe the relationship between a channel or actor with a threat actor. These actors or channels may have connections to more than one threat actor.
The labels can also be combined. The nature of the threat actor should be added:
E.g. Chinese State-funded and Editorially Controlled Media.
Party Y funded media.
Separate the different labels with a “;”.
In case you are not sure about the attribution, add “unkown”. 


Official channels
Channels overtly say that they are the official channels of a threat actor, government, official, or government agencies.
E.g. the websites and social media channels of the MFA, State Department, diplomats, and elected officials.
Examples of Indicators:
The channel publicly admits to being a channel of a state.
Note: watch out for satire and impersonation channels.

Controlled entity
 An entity that a threat actor editorially controls.


Examples:
A state media without editorial freedom. 	
 	
Media controlled by a political party.
 	
Journalists in repressive environments whose online presence needs to be approved by the state and is monitored.


Examples of Indicators:
The channel publicly admits to being state-controlled (easily accessible or legacy pages stating that they are the national media of a country or the official media of an entity).
 	
Has been attributed by trusted sources using proprietary or classified sources.
 	
The legal framework of the country forces control.
 	
The board of directors or the president is set by the threat actor.


Funded entity
An entity funded wholly by a threat actor. Funding may not necessarily mean that they are controlled.
Examples:
A media entity gets its funding completely covered by a state.
A person employed by a threat actor-controlled entity.
E.g. Researcher or journalist at a state-controlled university or media.
Examples of Indicators:
Tax or other administrative documents.
 	
Annual report.
 	
Public declaration of funding on their website or social media.
 	
A dedicated page on a threat actor's website.
 	
Description in content byline.


Supported entity
Partially funded or supported by a threat actor.
Funding can come in the shape of grants, subsidies, and donations.

Examples:

 Threat actor providing:
IT infrastructure, 	
 	
Offices.
 	
Venues (repeated). 	
 	
Recording studio.


Examples of Indicators:
Address of the venue for an event,
 	
Office 	addresses,
 	
IP address.
 	
Tax documents and other official documents concerning subsidies and donations.
 	
Public statements about funding. 	



Affiliated entity
An entity that has partnerships or commercial relations with a threat actor.
Examples:
Shared offices,
 	
organise events together, 	
 	
supply each other with services. 	
 	
A commercial partnership can entail the channel providing threat actor-owned entities with services such as content production.





Examples of Indicators:



Address of the venue for an event,
 	
Office 	addresses,
 	
Tax documents and other official documents concerning business transactions.
 	
Public statements about partnerships or commercial deals.





Systematically amplified


Support can also come from a threat actor through systematically promoting a channel or actor, giving them exposure to the threat actor's existing audiences.
Examples:
An expert is regularly being asked for comments by state-controlled media
 	
Diplomats regularly share content from specific social media pages
 	
State-controlled influencers are doing regular collaborations with unattributed influencers. 	





Examples of Indicators:
Threat actor-owned channels share content at regular intervals from the amplified entity.
Threat actor-owned channels share a regular amount of content from the amplified entity, e.g. every month.
A threat actor-owned channel’s promotion of content from the amplified entity stands out in comparison to other channels being amplified.

Systematic amplifier
An entity regularly amplifying a state actor’s content or entities



Examples:
An actor regularly shares content from state-controlled channels to their own channels.
 	
An actor regularly interviews people tied to a threat actor.
 	
An actor regularly quoting or using excerpts from state-controlled entities. 	





Examples of Indicators:



Entity shares content at regular intervals from threat actor-owned channels.
 	
Entity shares a regular amount of content from the threat actor-owned channels e.g. every month.
 	
Entity 	promotion of content from the threat actor-owned channel stands out in comparison to other channels being amplified.


Propagator
 An actor who is promoting narratives aligning with a threat actor.
Example:
Regularly promoting very specific narratives that are not in the mainstream, 	such as denying the Xinjiang massacre.
 	
Making statements of support to a threat actor. 	



Examples of Indicators:
Narratives in videos
 	
Narratives in articles.
 	
Narratives in posts.
