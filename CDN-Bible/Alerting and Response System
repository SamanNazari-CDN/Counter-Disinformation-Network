When you have compiled a one-pager, send it to the CDN coordinator via Slack.
Usually, this will be Saman Nazari. 

Provide them with context on who you want to reach and what you want to achieve. 
Sam will review the one-pager, potentially propose some edits, compile an email, and show it to you for review. 

When you are happy with it, Sam will send it out to the responder's mailing list with you in CC and a line encouraging the responders to reach out to you directly if they wish to know more about your findings or other calls for action. 

We very much welcome you sending us any contacts you think would benefit from being on the CDN responders mailing list. 

On occasions where we find something that needs urgent attention or action, we can also mobilise the willing members of the CDN around doing an outreach campaign, collectively making a lot of noise.
